Directory Entries:
- These are our directories.
- They are comprised of a name (dname) and a counter variable (nFiles) which tracks how many
files are in the directory.
- They contain an array of files
- We have an enumerated list of all possible files in a directory.

File Entries
- Contain a null terminated file name and extension.
- Have a file size.
- Has a nStartBlock that determines where a file lives on the disk
- nStartBlock will contain the index of where our file starts on the disk.

getattr
- Used to find information about a file. Will fill in a stat structure with information on the file (size, protections, etc...)
- Returns 0 on success, -ENOENT on error
- Given a stat structure that contains information about a file a specific path.
    + mode_t: protection mode
    + st_size: file size in bytes
    + st_nlink(?)
- (?) Does the path contain the file name as well?
    + IE: Is it /Users/welshej/Desktop/ or /Users/welshej/Desktop/file.txt

readdir
- Filler
    (?) I see that the third argument of filler() can take a stat struct, similar to the one that we see in getattr().
    Should we fill this in?
    (?) The final argument of filler takes the "offset of the next directory entry." What does this mean and why do we
    need it?
